# hello-world
This is the first repository aka the Hello World.
I am Ben Ravancho, a 5th year student, double majoring in Cybersecurity and IT Networking. I chose to double major since it only adds 4 classes that will fill the spots of non-major IT electives. When it comes to my hobbies I like to play video games both casually and competitively, as I have played on various eSports teams through UC's eSports club.
